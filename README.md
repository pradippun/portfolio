## HR Data Analytics and Visualisation

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the current HR data of a company. By creating a data visualisation dashboard that contains various aspects of the HR data, we seek to identify trends and gain a deeper understanding of the company's employees in one easily accessible dashboard.

### Data Sources

HR Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the [HR Data.xlsx](https://github.com/pradippun/portfolio/blob/main/HR%20Data.xlsx) file, containing detailed information about each employee who has worked for the company.  

### Tools
- **Excel** - Data Cleaning/ Preparing CSV file for SQL table [hrdata.csv](https://github.com/pradippun/portfolio/blob/main/hrdata.csv)
- **Tableau** - Data Visualisation - [HR Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradip.pun/viz/HRAnalyticsDashboard_16986995899550/HRANALYTICSDASHBOARD) 
- **PostgreSQL** - Running test for the Tableau report using [SQL Queries](https://github.com/pradippun/portfolio/blob/main/HR_Data_Test_SQL.sql)

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Data Visualisation
For the data visualisation, I have used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that contains information such as KPIs, department attrition share, and job satisfaction ratings by job roles.
Following are some of the Tableau features I have used to create the dashboard. 
1. Calculated Fields to calculate the attrition count and attrition rate %.
2. Heat Map Chart to show the job satisfaction rating.
3. Bin Size in bar chart to group the age.
4. Pie Chart and Dual Axis to create a Donut Chart.
